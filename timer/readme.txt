Description
-----------
This is a complete rip of the timer routines used by Cubic's OpenCP. I found
that these are the most complete and useable timer routines, there are for
WATCOM C/C++ 11.x.

Including the ability to setup an interrupt routine in protected mode with a
defineable stack size and the lib runs flawlessly in a Win95 DOS Box.

I ripped the necessary code out of the OpenCP 2.6.0pre4 source distribution
and made a nice little lib for easy usage.

Building
