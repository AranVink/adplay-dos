AdPlay/DOS To Do List:

- Colorize file selector.
- Sort file selector.
- Add ARJ and RAR archive reading support.
- Write more on-line help (f.e. linked AdPlug library version). [dynamite]
- Fix commandline playing '-b' mode
- Add default color scheme option to default configuration
- During playback, when pressing ESC once should just stop the song instead of
  exit immediately.
- Use TEMP in addition to TMP environment variable.
- If none of the TEMP and TMP variables is defined, extract to another defined
  directory instead of to the current directory.
- Use a unique subdirectory under the TEMP directory for temporary file
  operations, instead of putting everything in the TEMP dir directly.
- Use Up/Down/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End keys specifically for each window.
