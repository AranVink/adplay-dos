AdPlay/DOS Build Requirements
-----------------------------
To compile AdPlay/DOS from source, you need at least Watcom C/C++ 11. This
is still a commercial compiler package, but there is ongoing effort to open
its source and make it a free, OSI-compliant compiler suite.

If you're interested in the current status of this project, please have a
look at http://www.openwatcom.org, the official site of the project. At the
time of this writing, beta releases of OpenWatcom are already available.

AdPlay/DOS depends on the following libraries:

Name:					Version:
-----					--------
AdPlug					>= 1.1
WATCOM Timer Library                    >= 1.0
WATCOM Textmode Window Classes          >= 1.0

All these libraries can be fetched from http://adplug.sourceforge.net.

AdPlay/DOS is configured to build with the PMODE/W DOS extender by default.
So, when using the standard install, you need PMODE/W v1.33, additionally. It
can be fetched freely from various sources on the Internet. I got my version
from http://www.programmersheaven.com.

PMODE/W isn't open source software, however. If you prefer another DOS
extender over PMODE/W, just specify the system definition of your extender
on the SYSTEM variable in your CONFIG.MIF file.

Build Instructions
------------------
Please read the file INSTALL.TXT for further build instructions.

Debug logging the AdPlug core library with AdPlay/DOS
-----------------------------------------------------
If you compiled the AdPlug core library with debug logging support enabled,
AdPlay/DOS automatically redirects the output from the default 'stderr' to a
file called 'debug.log' in the directory, it was started from. This is to
prevent screen cluttering, which would otherwise occur when AdPlug is logging
directly to the console, on which AdPlay/DOS has its GUI output.

Debug logging AdPlay/DOS
------------------------
To enable debug logging, add this line to your CONFIG.MIF file:

CPPFLAGS += -dDEBUG

This instructs all source files to generate debug logging output. The output
goes to different logfiles by default. Please refer to the source code for
information on the file names.
