AdPlay/DOS Build Requirements
-----------------------------
To compile AdPlay/DOS from source, you need at least Watcom C/C++ 11. This
is still a commercial compiler package, but there is ongoing effort to open
its source and make it a free, OSI-compliant compiler suite.

If you're interested in the current status of this project, please have a
look at http://www.openwatcom.org, the official site of the project. At the
time of this writing, beta releases of OpenWatcom are already available.

AdPlay/DOS depends on the following libraries:

Name:					Version:
-----					--------
AdPlug					>= 1.1
WATCOM C/C++ 11.x Timer Library		>= 1.0
WATCOM C/C++ Textmode Window Classes	>= 1.0

The AdPlug library can be fetched from http://adplug.sourceforge.net. The
other two libraries are included with the AdPlay/DOS distribution. They can
be found in the 'timer' and 'window' subdirectories, respectively.

Build Instructions
